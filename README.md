# Food Card UI

## Project Overview

This project is a simple and responsive **Food Card UI** built using HTML and CSS Grid. It features a grid layout that displays food items as cards with details like images, names, descriptions, and prices. This UI design is perfect for a restaurant or food delivery website, showcasing various dishes in an organized and visually appealing way.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The food cards are arranged in a grid layout, which adjusts based on the screen size (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Grid-Based Layout**: CSS Grid is used to arrange the cards neatly, with each card featuring an image, name, description, and price of the food item.
- **Modern UI Design**: Clean, minimalistic, and user-friendly design suitable for any food-related platform.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the structure for the food cards.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that handles styling and layout, using CSS Grid.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: Each food card is represented by a `div` element containing an image, food name, description, and price.
- **CSS Grid Layout**: CSS Grid is used to organize the food cards in a responsive grid. On larger screens, multiple cards are displayed in rows and columns, while on smaller screens, the cards adjust to fit the width of the device.
